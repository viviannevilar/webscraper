# Webscraper to price data from Woolworths and Coles' websites

This repository contains scripts to grab prices of fruit and vegetables from Woolworths and Coles' websites.

The scripts are written in AppleScript, which work as the "driver" to open Safari, go to a webpage, do loops, etc. The scripts also execute JavaScript commands to grab the data from the DOM.

While the scripts are running you can't use your computer or it won't work properly.
